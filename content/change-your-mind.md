One of the things that politicians are often criticized for by their peers and the public is "flip-flopping". Now, if they promised one thing and do the opposite that is certainly a problem. But what if they just changed their mind? Is it such a bad thing to change ones mind? Should someone be ridiculed simply for the fact that they *did* change their mind? I would argue no. It might be justified to criticize the persons new position, but not the fact that they changed their mind in the first place. Indeed, changing our minds is one of the most powerful things we can do to grow and better ourselves.

As we live our lives we are constantly observing our surroundings. We learn from our own experiences and the experiences of other people, either directly through observation and conversation or indirectly through works of art and literature. From the time we are born until the time we die we accumulate these memories and experiences and form a kind of *pool of knowledge* for ourselves to draw upon. Each of us has their own pool of knowledge but for everyone their pool is growing and for everyone their pool is incomplete. For these two reasons it is imperative that we are willing to change our minds!

The classic example is the shape of the Earth. As we all know, in the past we thought the Earth was flat. And rightly so. We didn't have any satellite images or aircraft to observe the curvature. We could only observe what we could see with our eyes and because the Earth is so large, it looks, to the naked eye, as if we are living on a flat surface. Remember, we had no concept of gravity yet and there were no telescopes to observe the shapes of the other planets. All we knew was that things fall straight down when we drop them. Given that, it seems reasonable to assume that if we were on a sphere, every direction would be downhill and we would just slide off if we went too far in any direction. How could the earth be round? All of our observations pointed to a flat Earth and none of our observations seemed to imply that a spherical Earth was even  possible. We had incomplete data and we all drew the wrong conclusions from it.

Although the idea of the Earth being round was first proved to be correct by [Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes) who calculated the Earths circumference and it's axial tilt in the 3rd century BCE the idea didn't become a common part of our collective pool of knowledge until many centuries later. I can't say what caused the ancient Greeks to dismiss Eratosthenes, maybe he was unpopular for his criticism of Aristotle, or perhaps the people were just too invested in the geocentric flat earth model that they just could not get past the cognitive dissonance that they must have felt when considering his idea. Whatever the reason, they didn't change their minds and ignorance was perpetuated for hundreds of years.

It is so important that, as we gain new information, as our pools fill, we must reevaluate the assumptions and conclusions that we've made in the past. Having more information allows us to make more informed decisions in life. Because our knowledge is always incomplete, we are never guaranteed to get things right but that is OK. When we get things wrong we can always learn more, reconsider our conclusions and change our position accordingly.

We can evolve our thinking about every aspect of life. Some of the obvious things we change our minds about is technology. We constantly throw out old, bad ideas and chase after new ones in the tech world. Fashion seems to change every season. We change our minds about social and economic ideas. It used to be normal for workers to spend twelve hours a day, six days a week at work. Then someone had the idea that happy workers might do a better job than sick, unhappy and exhausted workers. Now we have 8 hour workdays and productivity is higher than ever because of well rested and happier workers.

Some of the most foundation shaking developments in history have been from people daring to be different. Those people changed their minds and were not afraid to tell others why they should change their minds as well. So be bold in your thinking, be insatiable in your learning, always challenge your assumptions and conclusions and don't let dogmatic thinking slow the worlds progress like it has so many times in the past.
