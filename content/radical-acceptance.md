When I go to the neurologists office I am often filled with anxious anticipation and a sense of profound hopelessness. Like so many times before, the doctor will ask me the same old questions. I will give my answers, the same as last time, and I will be told to come back in six months so the doctor can monitor the progress of my condition. It has been like that for over three years but now I am going to try something new. It is an idea that my therapist and I had discussed some time ago but that I had not taken to heart until now. That idea is radical acceptance.

At first I had dismissed radical acceptance as a fancy term for turning off my give-a-crap meter when it comes to my body. Essentially I had misinterpreted the idea as: If I just don't care about the thing that is making me sad then I wont be sad anymore. And that is part of it, kind of. But it's also missing the main point of the idea.

When we are healthy, we don't get depressed because we can't fly. There aren't any people on antidepressants because they can't lift ten thousand pounds or because they can't breathe underwater. There are no suicides because the person just can't survive a lovely [earthrise](https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_1249.html) on the moon without a spacesuit. These are all things that humans can't do and we all accept them. I would even say that we radically accept them.

That doesn't mean that we don't think about flying, or walking on the moon. As we all know we work very hard and use every scientific advancement at our disposal to help us create aircraft that allow us to fly farther, fly faster and fly cheaper. We have submarines and diving equipment that allow us to explore underwater. We can't breathe water, but with our technology we don't need to. A few intrepid explorers have even set foot on the moon.

No, radical acceptance is not about forgetting about the past. It's about starting down a path that hopefully leads us to living the best life we can as the person we are, right now. It's about accepting the boundaries and limitations that we all have and then pushing those boundaries and reducing those limitations. It's about letting go of the things we can't control but also taking control of the things we can.

When I first began writing this post I had intended to write about having an undiagnosed medical condition. However after I was half way through the introduction it was clear that I actually wanted to write about radical acceptance. I even refined my views about it as I thought about the ideas I wanted to convey. I am even more convinced now that radical acceptance about ourselves and our bodies is a very healthy and positive idea to hold.

To some, radical acceptance is their default state and I'm sure that is a wonderful place to be in life. But for others who are more like me and who have to learn and process everything I hope this post has helped clarify this topic. All I can ask is that you consider my words, make up your own mind, and make sure you are trying to be your best you.
