I'm going to step out of my comfort zone and write about social anxiety. The thought of sharing something that I consider so personal with a complete stranger causes a fear response in me that I can feel in the pit of my stomach. But my therapist suggested that starting a blog could help me explore things like this, so I am going to try.

The end result of extended periods of untreated social anxiety is almost complete isolation. After high school I lost contact with many of my friends. That is normal. Since high school I have not made a single new friend. That is not normal. It's not like I have never spoken to anyone. I've learned a few new people's names. But they are all acquaintances. I have never gotten past that overly polite stage when you meet a new person. I'm not sure how to do it. The nervous feelings of worry and judgement are so overwhelming that most of the time it's just easier not to speak at all.

For me, the first signs of social anxiety came in late middle school, Around 8th grade or so. It was subtle at first. I was, "just shy", you see. I did have a small group of close friends which allowed me to exercise my social skills regularly, so that was very fortunate for me. Without them I believe my isolating behavior might have started much sooner in my life.

In high school and shortly thereafter I had a period of testosterone driven false bravado and shameful macho aggression. Looking back at this period in my life, I feel like the "mask" I was putting on in public was keeping me from forming very many meaningful friendships. After all, everyone I was interacting with the mask, not me. I was spending time with people, which was good, but they were not spending time with me. All of the fake friends of high school were quick to disappear afterward of course. Soon I found myself with only two real friends and the interactions with them even began to dwindle.

I could work at OfficeMax selling computers and instill enough confidence in my customers that they would bring their computers into the store just to have me fix them. But I could not strike up a conversation with a co-worker I had known for six months in the break room. I could enter a structured conversation that was dedicated to a specific topic, but began to feel completely overwhelmed when in a casual interaction like a waiting room or the home of a friend of a friend. The discomfort in these situations began to morph into something more sinister.

I recall a 4th of July party on some riverside property. There was alcohol and food. A pig was roasted in the ground in fact. There was live music and fireworks after the sun went down. I spent most of that party wandering along the river trying to pass the time by wishing I was somewhere else.

The last big social gathering I attended was my sister's wedding reception. I wanted to have fun. I wanted to be happy and make a wonderful memory with my family and my sisters new family. There were a lot of people my age. And it was a potluck, there was more food than anyone could have eaten. I spent most of the reception standing near the edge of the party in the backyard. I was breathing hard and my heart was racing. I wanted to bolt and run if anyone approached me but thankfully I had enough self control to avoid that. I remember trying to calm myself by closing my eyes and taking deep breaths but nothing seemed to help calm the feelings of dread and my shame at my seeming unfitness for even having fun.

After the wedding reception my isolation really began. I would decline invites from my two remaining friends if it involved anything where we might encounter strangers or even worse, peers. I eventually just stopped interacting with anyone but my family. I lost contact with my last two friends for what I consider justified reasons, but I can't help but feel that subconsciously my anxiety may have played a roll in making those decisions.

Having a (perhaps?) overly analytical mind just makes this whole social anxiety deal that much worse. Imagine a parent explaining to their two year old several really good reasons why they can't have another cookie only to have the toddler ask for another cookie right after the explanation. I can list reasons why I shouldn't feel the way I do all day long but my emotions just tell me I should sit in a dark room alone all day. It's fear, judgement, unease, nausea and discomfort. It's doubting yourself and it's doubting others. It's irrational, illogical and unreasonable. It's a part of millions of people's lives, or so they say, as if knowing that others are suffering too somehow helps. It's part of me, that is for sure. I'll likely always have social anxiety but for now I just need to keep taking small steps in the right direction.
