Back in the dark ages around the turn of the millennium I was in my last year of middle school and my view of world was much different than it is today. To put it into perspective: 9/11 was still over a year away, The dot-com bubble was about to burst, Playstation 2 would soon make its debut and the Dixie Chicks album Fly was a smash hit. I was almost exclusively a metal-head at the time and I find it a bit ironic that I am writing a blog post about the lyrics to a country song, especially a Dixie Chicks song. Eww. Kidding, kidding, mostly.

## Goodbye Earl

My sister and I have a tradition of showing each other new music as well as digging up old hits from the past. Yesterday she asked me to play the song "Goodbye Earl" by the Dixie Chicks. Its a catchy song, even if country still isn't my favorite genre, I can appreciate almost any piece of music these days. It isn't exactly the song I want to discuss, but rather something my sister said to me after we listened to it. I have a feeling my younger self would have agreed with my sister but my older and perhaps wiser self disagrees with her (sorry dear sister). But first a bit of context about the song itself.

"Goodbye Earl" is the 5th song on the Dixie Chicks album Fly. The upbeat tune obscures the somewhat grim tale of a woman who grows up to marry a man in her small town who almost immediately starts abusing her. After building up the courage to file for divorce and a restraining order he beats her savagely, leaving her in the hospital. A friend who is mentioned at the beginning of the song visits her and the two decide that the only option remaining is to kill Earl. So they do. They make a plan, carry it out and no one misses the jackass.

## Was the killing of Earl justified?

Before I say anything else I want to be clear, however controversial they are, I don't think that the Dixie Chicks are advocating that abused spouses murder their abusers. I think "Goodbye Earl" has excellent lyrics and uses dark humor to convey the helplessness and the resulting anger that many abused people must feel. Again, to be clear, my argument isn't with the Dixie Chicks directly, it is with my sisters suggestion that maybe the heroines of the song were right in the killing of Earl. 

When it was suggested that Earls murder was justified my heckles immediately raised. As a humanist I believe that the only truly inherent right that we have as human beings is the right to life. All other rights we imbue ourselves with. Life is the first thing we get, and its the last thing we loose. To say someone deserves to die is to say they did something so heinous that all of their past experiences, all of their future experiences, everything that makes them a person and not just a hunk of meat, is forfeit.

To me, that is a high bar indeed. Consider existential fear. Fear that most of us have not known. A gun pointed at the head. Being trapped in a sinking ship. An inescapable fire. A parachute that wont open. In contemplating these things, we are contemplating the end of life. The end of our existence. No more fun, no more worry, no more anger, no more love, no moreâ€¦you. Self preservation is perhaps one of the basest of instincts. A human instinct that we all share. In acknowledging that common humanity we have to acknowledge Earls as well as our own.

## For Rule of Law

When the discussion first started I pointed out that we are weighing the violation of a restraining order, assault and battery against murder. In the eyes of the law murder is clearly the worst offense. Its the old two wrongs don't make a right trope. My sister had to agree, yes, murder is worse than assault. But, she said, the heroine in the song had to consider her future. The 'piece of paper' didn't stop him this time it would not stop him in the future, she argued. Because we know that abusive husbands are more likely to kill their wives, she was just preemptively defending herself thus she was justified in the murder.

I had to point out first that the 'piece of paper' may not have prevented the beating, but if this story were happening in real life, Earl would have been put in prison for violating the restraining order and assaulting his wife. In this case the rule of law would have likely saved the heroine from feeling the need to commit murder and would have saved Earl himself from being murdered. After a couple years in prison, its possible Earl could get out and try to get revenge. But its also possible that he had a long time to think in prison and decided that he would change his life to avoid going back.

## For Society

One of our most basic understandings of morality, the ethic of reciprocity or more commonly known as the golden rule, has allowed us to make moral progress for thousands of years. When applied at the societal level we understand that although we cannot control the actions of others, we can control our own actions and by demonstrating good behavior we encourage others to behave as well. We know that if someone harms us and we harm them back, in most situations we have both done wrong. We recognize that most of the people in our society want to live together and get along but also acknowledge that there have always (at least so far) been people who do not accept the ethic of reciprocity, or at least don't accept it in some circumstances. These are the times that the rule of law has to step in. Because we have collectively given authority to the government to carry out the rule of law for us, it is wrong for us to do so ourselves. By being a vigilante, or dispensing street justice, we are violating the ethic of reciprocity and thus encouraging bad behavior in others. Society is made up of individuals who all take actions, as long as most of those actions are neutral or contribute to the well being of society we all thrive. The more people who take actions that detract from human well-being the worst off all of us are. What happens to one of us, happens to all of us.

## But not for Earl

I hope it is clear by now that the only thing I am defending is Earl's life. In my opinion he is a good example of a real piece of trash. If he doesn't change his ways he likely deserves to die alone, a bitter old man. Given the events in the song he would likely receive several years in prison and I would personally hope that his prison 'buddies' hear about exactly what got Earl locked up and make his stay that much worse.
