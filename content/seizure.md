On July 7th at around 7pm I had a seizure. It was one of the
strangest experiences I have ever, well, experienced. All that
morning and into that afternoon I had felt nauseous. Not like I
was going to vomit, but just, blah. However, nothing about my
queasy stomach led me to suspect that I might be about to have
such a strange and unexpected ordeal.

There was no warning. I take that back. The nausea was a warning
but nausea is so common one cannot assume a seisure is going to
occur every time one has a pang of nausea. But aside from that,
there was no warning. I was enjoying a quiet evening at home in
my room when suddenly it was like my brain stopped recording
memories. The first thing I recall is the feeling of being lifted
up into the back of the ambulance. I was on a stretcher looking
up at the sky and could just barely hear the voice of the ambulance
technician as they tried to get me to respond. It was like recalling
the memory of an event that had occurred in a dream. I was seeing
through my own eyes, but it still wasn't REAL.

The first hour or two after the seizure were like that. Just half
seen glimpses of moments, as if experiencing another persons life.
The back of an ambulance, the face of a doctor, the inside of a CT
scan tube, the sound of my Mother's voice, the smell of a sterile
hospital room. These experiences rolled over me like waves in a
dream. Although I remember these things, I wasn't really there. Sure
physically I was there, but me, that thing that controls this human
shell, was not present. It was like the lights flickered on at times
but there was really no one home.

Suddenly I was laying in a hospital bed being wheeled down a well-lit
hallway. We turned into a hospital room and the kind voice of a nurse
announced that this was my room and that I should try to relax for a
while. My thoughts started to come together and I began wondering what
was happening. My Mother entered the room and I wanted to speak but 
I'm not sure anything resembling an English sentence escaped my lips.
"You had a seizure", she said in a quivering voice, chocking back the
tears that were nevertheless visible behind her eyes.

The next few hours were spent answering my questions and monitoring
my vitals. They thought my seizure was caused by the Bupropion that
I had been taking for depression and anxiety. Although the drug was
working well for me, it does have a very rare side effect of seizures
and it seems I had finally beaten the odds.

Thankfully my labs and vitals returned to normal and I was able to
go back home that same night. I got home at around midnight and went
right to bed. I don't really know what happened the next day. My
parents said I slept nearly the whole day. I don't recall anything. In
fact, I thought the whole ordeal had happened on Thursday, but it
actually happened on Tuesday. I didn't realize this until this morning
when I began to write this blog post and was double checking some facts
with my Mom and Dad when I figured out I am missing nearly 2 days of
memories.

Besides my mental side effects, I also feel like I got my ass kicked by
a pro wrestler. Almost every muscle in my body is stiff and sore. My
legs are tired and weaker than normal. Every muscle feels like it was
worked out beyond its breaking point.

We all like to think our minds are reliable and our thoughts are
correct. But at times like this I am reminded just how fragile these
human vessels truly are. We like to believe that we are in control
when in reality there are autonomous processes going on in our minds
and our bodies that we have literally zero control over. We rely
on these things, despite being reminded at times like these just how
unreliable our built in circuitry really is. It's almost funny, really.
We each have a copy of these flawed tools and we simultaneously know
they they are both accurate and flawed. They are both reliable enough
to trust our lives on at times, and yet, we still know that only a fool
would trust something that is so often wildly wrong.

Brains are strange.
