I am creating this blog to create a record of my activities that I can look back on in the future. I love nostalgia. It could also be a place for people who have similar interests could find (hopefully) cool ideas and projects. Also, as I am an overly analytical person, I plan to use this medium to explore my emotions. If you are interested in only a specific topic you can filter my posts by category or tags.

I am a 33 year old male who is fortunate enough to live in the beautifully temperate pacific northwest (USA). I am a technology enthusiast who enjoys all things [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) and [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source). When it comes to opinionated ramblings about specific distributions of Linux, you'll find I am almost exclusively a [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) user.

I make a hobby out of studying computer programming. I am mostly using Rust these days, but in the past I've also used python. In school I learned about C#, Java and Perl, but I have not used those very much since then. Speaking of school, I have an associates degree in Data Networks and Telecommunications from [Clark College](http://www.clark.edu/). I almost completed a bachelors degree at [Western Governors University](https://www.wgu.edu/), but personal and health problems have caused me to put that on hold for now.

In 2015 I began to have problems controlling my muscles. Unexplained pain soon turned into excessive weakness. In about an 8 month period I went from walking a mile to work everyday to barely being able to stand. From considering myself fairly strong, to feeling like a gallon of milk was more like a medicine ball. The doctors ran many blood tests, EEG's and MRI's. Every test came back 'normal' but the symptoms remained. Finally after seeing my 4th neurologist I was told that I have [functional neurological disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_neurological_symptom_disorder).

And that brings me to the dervish dance that is my current emotional state. I have always battled with social anxiety, but after my diagnosis it grew worse and has been accompanied by depression. Thankfully I have great support from my family as well as a competent therapist.
Computer Video games has also always been a passion of mine. I love [Blizzard](https://www.blizzard.com) games and am a huge fan of the [Elder Scrolls](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net) series. When I was younger I fancied myself a competitive StarCraft player, but since my muscles have stopped cooperating, I can't really compete with other human players anymore. However, that is ok, I've gotten used to that fact and have embraced slower paced games like [Civilization](https://civilization.com/) that don't require extreme speed or accuracy.
