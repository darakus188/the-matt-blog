    <div class="post-content">
      <p>I am a 33 year old male who is fortunate enough to live in the beautifully temperate pacific northwest (USA). I am a technology enthusiast who enjoys all things <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">Open Source</a>. When it comes to opinionated ramblings about specific distributions of Linux, you'll find I am almost exclusively a <a href="https://getfedora.org/">Fedora</a> user.</p>
<p>I make a hobby out of studying computer programming. I am mostly using Rust these days, but in the past I've also used python. In school I learned about C#, Java and Perl, but I have not used those very much since then. Speaking of school, I have an associates degree in Data Networks and Telecommunications from <a href="http://www.clark.edu/">Clark College</a>. I almost completed a bachelors degree at <a href="https://www.wgu.edu/">Western Governors University</a>, but personal and health problems have caused me to put that on hold for now.</p>
<p>In 2015 I began to have problems controlling my muscles. Unexplained pain soon turned into excessive weakness. In about an 8 month period I went from walking a mile to work everyday to barely being able to stand. From considering myself fairly strong, to feeling like a gallon of milk was more like a medicine ball. The doctors ran many blood tests, EEG's and MRI's. Every test came back 'normal' but the symptoms remained. Finally after seeing my 4th neurologist I was told that I have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_neurological_symptom_disorder">functional neurological disorder</a>.</p>
<p>And that brings me to the dervish dance that is my current emotional state. I have always battled with social anxiety, but after my diagnosis it grew worse and has been accompanied by depression. Thankfully I have great support from my family as well as a competent therapist.
Computer Video games has also always been a passion of mine. I love <a href="https://www.blizzard.com">Blizzard</a> games and am a huge fan of the <a href="https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net">Elder Scrolls</a> series. When I was younger I fancied myself a competitive StarCraft player, but since my muscles have stopped cooperating, I can't really compete with other human players anymore. However, that is ok, I've gotten used to that fact and have embraced slower paced games like <a href="https://civilization.com/">Civilization</a> that don't require extreme speed or accuracy. </p>
