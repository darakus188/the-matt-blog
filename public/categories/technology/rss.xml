                <description>&lt;p&gt;When I set out to create a personal blog I had only a vague idea of what the
possibilities were. I had heard about this fancy wizbang content management
system called &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wordpress.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Wordpress&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. After taking a look at
Wordpress I was fairly impressed. There is quite an ecosystem of themes and
plugins which allows for nearly limitless design flexibility. Wordpress enjoys
many web hosts who cater specifically to its user base. For a modest fee, these
companies will do most of the &lt;em&gt;not so hard&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; work of getting an instance of
Wordpress running on a web server. It was all rather slick and easy. So of
course I decided that was certainly not the direction for me to take.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
